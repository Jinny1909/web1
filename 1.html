<h2>HTML</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/"target ="_blank" title="html5 speicification">HTML MEANING</a> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. ...
<br><strong><u>HTML</u> elements</strong> are the building blocks of HTML pages.
In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, <br>a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.
<br>In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3]
Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year,<br>
Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.
The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7]<br>
 It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid,<br>
 an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]</p>
